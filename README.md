## The examined geographic area
The area that was examined in this lab was the Seattle area and the areas around Seattle. This lab looked at police precinct locations around Seattle as well as different layers based on themes such as monochrome and the Black Lives Matters movement, a movement that has great history in Seattle and its beliefs of contesting police brutality.
